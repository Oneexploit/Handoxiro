This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures. By detecting the thumb and index finger positions, users can move the mouse and simulate clicks by pinching the fingers. It also supports drag-and-drop functionality, making it perfect for gesture-based interfaces and wireless control.
